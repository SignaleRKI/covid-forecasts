  <h3 class="display-3">About</h3>
  <p>
    The German and Polish COVID-19 ForecastHub aims to bring together short-term forecasts of the further course of the
    pandemic in Germany and Poland. Our goal is to systematically compare different predictions, identify particularly
    reliable models and assess whether combinations of different forecasts can yield more reliable results.
  </p>

  <p>
    The platform is run by members of the <a href="https://statistik.econ.kit.edu/index.php">Chair of Statistics and
      Econometrics</a> at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the <a href="https://www.h-its.org/research/cst/">Computational Statistics
    Group</a> at Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies, with support from the
    <a href="https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/signals/signals_node.html" target="_blank">Signale
      Team at Robert Koch Institut</a>. The project is developed in close
    exchange with the <a href="https://covid19forecasthub.org/doc/" target="_blank">US COVID-19 ForecastHub</a> run by
    the <a href="https://reichlab.io/" target="_blank">Reich Lab</a> at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is public and all forecasts can be downloaded from our <a
      href="https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de" target="_blank">github repository</a>. More ample
    information on this project can be found in
    the associated <a href="https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de/wiki" target="_blank">Wiki</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The German and Polish COVID-19 Forecast Hub also forms the basis of a pre-registered forecast evaluation study on
    which we plan to report in 2021. The protocol is available <a href="https://osf.io/cy937/registrations" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h4 class="display-4">Forecast Targets</h4>

  <p>We currently focus on short-term forecasts of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. Both targets are addressed
    both at an incident (i.e. weekly new cases and deaths) and a cumulative scale (total cases and deaths). New
    forecasts are issued every Monday/Tuesday and cover forecast horizons of one through four weeks into the future. A
    detailed description of forecast targets can be found <a
      href="https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de/wiki/Forecast-targets" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>

  <a id="limitations"><h4 class="display-4" style="padding-top: 55px; margin-top: -55px;" >Interpretation of Forecasts / Limitations</h4></a>

  <p>Our project aims at both providing forecasts in real time and evaluating systematically how reliable these forecasts are.
    Please keep the following in mind when interpreting forecasts:
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li> <b>COVID-19 forecasts have proven challenging in the past.</b> Especially case forecasts have not always been accurate
  (as deaths are a more lagged measure they are somewhat easier to predict).</li>
  <li>We collect model outputs up to four weeks into the future, but <b>recommend focusing on forecasts one and two weeks into the future</b>.</li>
  <li>Confirmed cases up to 1 to 2 weeks ahead and deaths up to 3 weeks ahead are assumed to be largely unaffected by future changes in control measures
  (see <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/938965/201031_SPI-M-O_medium_term_projections_explainer.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
  for a similar reasoning by the UK Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling). Beyond these time horizons, outputs from most models should be interpreted
  as <b>"baseline projections"</b>, i.e. projections under the assumption of no change in interventions, behaviour and testing.
  They are no longer valid if these aspects change.</li>
  <li> Forecasters are asked to quantify the uncertainty of their forecasts via prediction intervals. However, the coverage of prediction intervals has empirically
  been lower than the nominal levels (i.e. 95% prediction intervals contained the eventually observed value in less than 95% of the cases).
  In other words, <b>uncertainty has been underestimated</b> and forecasts were on average too confident.</li>
  <li>We expect the course of the epidemic around <b>Christmas</b> to be difficult to predict, so forecasts should be interpreted with special care.</li>
  </ul>
  

  <h4 class="display-4">Forecast Evaluation</h4>
  <p>
    One goal of this platform is to compare the forecast performance of different models systematically. Results will be
    included on this website shortly. An outline of the methods used for evaluation can be found in this <a
      href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12881" target="_blank">preprint</a>.
  </p>

  <h4 class="display-4">Ensemble Building</h4>
  <p>
    Each week we combine the different forecasts submitted to the platform into so-called ensemble forecasts. Such
    combined forecasts are known to yield more reliable predictions in many domains and are becoming increasingly used
    in epidemiology. See <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.20177493v1"
      target="_blank">here</a> for a recent preprint on
    ensemble forecasts based on the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Technical details are provided in <a
      href="https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de/wiki/Creation-of-equally-weighted-ensemble"
      target="_blank">this wiki entry</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    More specifically, we provide three different ensemble models that are computed as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>KITCOVIDhub-median_ensemble</b> <br> An average of forecasts submitted by different models, computed as the median (per quantile). </li>
    <li><b>KITCOVIDhub-mean_ensemble</b> <br> An average of forecasts submitted by different models, computed as the mean (per quantile). </li>
    <li><b>KITCOVIDhub-inverse_WIS_ensemble</b> <br> A weighted average of forecasts submitted by different models,
    with weights computed from the average performance over the last three weeks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="display-4">Baselines</h4>
  <p>
    As a reference in our forecast evaluation study the Forecast Hub Team generates forecasts from two simple reference models:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>KIT-baseline</b> <br> A naive model that always predicts that the number of new cases/deaths will be the same as last week (in expectation). </li>
    <li><b>KIT-time_series_baseline</b> <br> A statistical time series model (exponential smoothing with multiplicative error terms). </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="display-4" id="datasources">Data Sources</h4>

  <p>Forecasts at the national level (both Poland and Germany) can refer to the two following data sources:</p>
